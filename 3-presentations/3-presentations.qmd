## One last thing: Templates

. . .

You can use someoneelse's template by running

```bash
quarto add <github-accnt>/<repo-name>
```

## Our Turn

:::task
- In the same directory as your slides qmd, run `quarto add qmdr/qmdrslides` at the terminal.
- Say yes to the prompts.
- Change the format of your slides to `qmdrslides-revealjs`
:::

## Your Turn

:::task
- Survey the community templates hosted at <https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/listing-revealjs.html>
- Select one to add to your document using `quarto add <github-accnt>/<repo-name>` at the terminal.
- Change the format of your slides to `<repo-name>-revealjs`.
- Render!
